Pre-requisites: Basic knowledge of APIs and Python (Not even Django!)

Knowing how to create APIs is one of the best superpowers that you can have as an Engineer. ðŸ‘€

If there is absolutely any data you can serve- JSON, Text, Dumps, Images, Music- Anything from your project output, you <b>need</b> to serve it in an API. The new JAMstack way of development (Which I will write about soon!) works by abstracting the database away, and serving the contents of the Database as JSON. I recently talked about Strapi, which is a headless CMS, doing exactly this.

DRF is a Django Rest Frameworks which makes it easier for us to make APIs. You can do the same thing in say plain ol' Django, or Node, or Flask- or any other language! But personally, I use DRF to make custom APIs.

In this article, we will develop an API for an employer! When I <i>curl</i> the final result, I get the names of all my friends.

```json
[{"firstname":"Abhinav","lastname":"Srivastava"},{"firstname":"Puja","lastname":"Chaudhury"},{"firstname":"Arun","lastname":"Kumar"},{"firstname":"Shaaran","lastname":"Lakshmi"}]
```

Not very fancy, right?  However, stay with me. Once I am done with the basics you will know how to scale this to your next project. Note that I am <i>not</i> using any environments, but you absolutely should. This is so that the average programmer here is not confused beside what they already are in terms of APIs. Make a file called drf-tutorial and cd into it.

```shell
mkdir drf-tutorial
cd drf-tutorial
```

Now you will need to install certain libraries in Python.

```python
pip install django
pip install djangorestframework
```

Once you have these installed, and are in chosen directory, start a Django Project.

```python
django-admin startproject myproject
cd myproject
python manage.py startapp myapp
```

This will give you a new project myproject and a new Django app called myapp. If you are familiar with Django, you already know the contents inside of myprojects and myapp. Incase you aren't, <a href="https://simpleisbetterthancomplex.com/series/2017/09/04/a-complete-beginners-guide-to-django-part-1.html">Here</a> is a great introduction to it.

______

Let's dig into the main code now! ðŸ™Œ

**Add rest_framework to Installed apps!**

Go to myproject/settings.py, and scroll down till you see <i>Installed Apps</i>

It should look something like this 

```python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    'django.contrib.admin',
    'django.contrib.auth',
    'django.contrib.contenttypes',
    'django.contrib.sessions',
    'django.contrib.messages',
    'django.contrib.staticfiles'
]
```

Change to include myapp and rest_framework to it.

```python
INSTALLED_APPS = [...
    'rest_framework',
    'myapp'
]
```



**Create your models**

Here is the <a hef="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/topics/db/models/">official documentation of Models</a>

> A model is the single, efinitive source of information about your data. It contains the essential fields and behaviors of the data youâ€™re storing. Generally, each model maps to a single database table.
>
> The basics:
>
> - Each model is a Python class that subclasses [`django.db.models.Model`](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/ref/models/instances/#django.db.models.Model).
> - Each attribute of the model represents a database field.
> - With all of this, Django gives you an automatically-generated database-access API

```python
from django.db import models

# Create your models here.
class employees(models.Model):
    firstname=models.CharField(max_length=10)
    lastname=models.CharField(max_length=10)
    emp_id=models.IntegerField()
    
    def __str__(self):
        return self.firstname
```

This would create a database equivalent of emp_id, firstname and lastname as columns. Time to <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/topics/migrations/">make migrations!</a>

```
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

**Under myapp you need to make a new Python file called serializer.py**

```python
from rest_framework import serializers
from . models import employees

class employeesSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
    
    class Meta:
        model=employees
        fields=('firstname','lastname')
```

"Abhinav, what's a serializer da"

I mean <a href="https://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/serializers/">DRF's official documentations</a> explain it best! (Don't worry about Class <a href="https://realpython.com/python-metaclasses/">Meta</a> now)

> Serializers allow complex data such as querysets and model instances to be converted to native Python datatypes that can then be easily rendered into `JSON`, `XML` or other content types.

We are taking the value and exporting it as JSON of firstname and lastname!

**Let's now create the views.py**

Views.py is responsible for what you will get on querying this data. It uses models and the serializer to render the JSON from Database.

```python
from django.shortcuts import render

# Create your views here.

from django.http import HttpResponse
from django.shortcuts import get_object_or_404
from rest_framework.views import APIView
from rest_framework.response import Response
from rest_framework import status
from . models import employees
from . serializers import employeesSerializer

class employeeList(APIView):

    def get(self, request):
        employees1=employees.objects.all()
        serializer=employeesSerializer(employees1, many=True)
        return Response(serializer.data)

    def post(self):
        pass #We are focusing on only GET requests for now!
```

We pass all the objects of employees class to employees1 variable. 

We declare a new variable serializer and call employeeSerializer which we declared in serializer.py

So-

1. employees1 takes all the objects of employees from models (from . models import employees)
2. Serializer is a variable to which the return value of employeeSerializer is passed
3. Thus to serializer, model values of firstname and lastname are passed as a dictionary

Now all we need to do is return the Response of serializer.data

And that's all from the logic perspective!

________

**Now we need to connect this logic to URLs.py!**

```python
from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import path

urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
]
```

It looks something like this now, but we will update it to include employee API.

```python
from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import path
from rest_framework.urlpatterns import format_suffix_patterns
from myapp import views

urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path('employees/', views.employeeList.as_view()),
]
```

path() takes a regular expression argument, just add the address where you'd like to see our API!

website/employees will have your API result in this. It goes to views.employeeList.as_view() [as_view() returns the response of the API as a callable view].

________

So now we are done!

```
python manage.py runserver
```

Now go to your localhost address specified in your command line output, and add a /employee.

You should get something like this-

You're done!

All the best, and tag me in your projects.
